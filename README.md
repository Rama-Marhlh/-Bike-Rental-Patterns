### **Bike Rental Patterns Analysis and Prediction**  
This project explores **Bike Rental Patterns** by leveraging a dataset provided by PyCaret to analyze, visualize, and model rental trends. The project integrates **Power BI** for interactive data visualization and dashboard creation, alongside **PyCaret** for machine learning and predictive modeling.

#### **Key Features**:
1. **Data Analysis and Visualization**:
   - Comprehensive analysis of the dataset to identify key trends and patterns in bike rentals.
   - Interactive **Power BI Dashboard** showcasing:
     - Hourly, daily, and seasonal rental trends.
     - Influence of weather, temperature, humidity, and other factors on bike rentals.
     - User segmentation and usage behavior analysis.

2. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Implemented machine learning models using **PyCaret** to predict bike rental counts based on weather conditions, time, and other features.
   - Explored multiple algorithms including regression and ensemble models to identify the best-performing approach.
   - Evaluated models using key performance metrics like RMSE, RÂ², and MAE.

3. **Insights**:
   - Key findings on how environmental and temporal factors impact bike rentals.
   - Predictive insights for optimizing bike availability and improving service delivery.

4. **Deployment**:
   - A GitHub repository containing:
     - **Power BI Dashboard** showcasing rental patterns and trends.
     - **Python scripts** for data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling.
     - **Data CSV file **

#### **Tools and Technologies**:
- **Power BI**: For creating an intuitive and interactive dashboard.
- **PyCaret**: Simplified and automated machine learning for predictive modeling.
- **Python**: For data preprocessing and custom analysis.
- **GitHub**: For project hosting and collaboration.
